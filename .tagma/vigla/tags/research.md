A #research node records a reading of something outside this project; `source` names what was read and where — its URL, version or copy. Separate observation from inference and say what the evidence does not establish; a measurement whose experiment was not kept says so: the record alone cannot reproduce it. Split a broad investigation by independent questions. A node resting on a reading relates to it and carries the versions and conditions it established, never a generalized result. Research says nothing about whether this project does what it studied.

A reading of code names the checkout, commit or version read.
