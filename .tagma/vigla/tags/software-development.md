The software-development catalog connects product understanding, accepted changes and the work realizing them.

When the product's behaviour changes, edit the block that describes it; never write a second block about the same behaviour beside it.

A subtree offered as an example for other work is first read against the code by someone who did not write it: a qualified body does not repair an overbroad title.

Write for a competent reader only the distinctions, conditions and reasons they cannot reliably infer — never what code or structure already says; write from the code, never its comments: the graph cuts prose, it does not move it. An orientation body is as short as its reason; a spec, research reading or rule takes the space its complete subject needs. Another subject is another node, never a longer body; one subject's conditions stay together. Examples earn their place by resolving ambiguity. An explicit data constraint names the real consuming contract requiring it; the reason, not a character cap, measures quality. Precision is judged per sentence: a title or body promising more than the code holds is a defect.
